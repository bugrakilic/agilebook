# Burnup Chart

A Burnup Chart displays work completed over time, helping track progress toward the project or release scope.

## Purpose

- Show how much work has been completed and how much remains  
- Visualize scope changes alongside progress  

## Components

- **X-axis:** Time (days in Sprint or project)  
- **Y-axis:** Work (story points, tasks, or hours)  
- **Scope line:** Total amount of work (can change with scope adjustments)  
- **Completed work line:** Work done so far  

## Benefits

- Clearly shows scope changes and their impact  
- Helps teams and stakeholders understand progress and forecast completion  
- Encourages adaptive planning  

## Limitations

- Slightly more complex than Burndown charts  
- Requires accurate scope tracking
