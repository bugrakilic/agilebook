# The 4 Agile Values

The Agile Manifesto is built upon four key values that prioritize collaboration, responsiveness, and customer focus.

## 1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools

- Emphasizes the importance of people and communication  
- Tools and processes support but do not replace human collaboration  

## 2. Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation

- Focuses on delivering functional software  
- Documentation should be just enough to support development and use  

## 3. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation

- Encourages continuous engagement with customers  
- Adapts requirements based on feedback rather than rigid contracts  

## 4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan

- Values flexibility and adaptability  
- Plans guide but do not constrain progress  

## Summary

While there is value in the items on the right, Agile prioritizes the items on the left for better outcomes.
