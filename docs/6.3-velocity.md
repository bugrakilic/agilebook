# Velocity

Velocity is a metric that measures the amount of work a team completes during a Sprint, usually expressed in Story Points.

## Purpose

- Helps teams understand their capacity  
- Provides a basis for Sprint planning and forecasting  
- Tracks team productivity over time  

## Calculation

- Sum of the Story Points for all completed backlog items in a Sprint  
- Only fully completed items count toward velocity  

## Usage

- Use velocity as a guide, not a target  
- Compare velocity trends over multiple Sprints to identify patterns  
- Adjust planning based on velocity changes  

## Best Practices

- Avoid using velocity for individual performance evaluation  
- Donâ€™t inflate story points to increase velocity  
- Focus on delivering value, not just increasing velocity
