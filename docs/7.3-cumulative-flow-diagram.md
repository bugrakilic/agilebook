# Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)

A Cumulative Flow Diagram visualizes the flow of work across different stages of a process over time.

## Purpose

- Track the status of work items in various workflow states  
- Identify bottlenecks and process inefficiencies  
- Help teams manage flow and improve predictability  

## Components

- **X-axis:** Time  
- **Y-axis:** Number of work items  
- Colored bands representing work in different states (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)  

## Interpretation

- Width of each band shows the number of tasks in that state  
- Stable and smooth flow is indicated by consistent band widths  
- Increasing width in a band suggests a bottleneck  

## Benefits

- Provides insight into workflow efficiency  
- Helps optimize cycle time and throughput  
- Supports data-driven process improvements  

## Limitations

- Requires consistent workflow state definitions  
- May be complex for beginners to interpret
