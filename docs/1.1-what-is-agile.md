# What is Agile?

## History & Evolution

Agile is a mindset and set of practices that emerged in response to the limitations of traditional project management approaches, often called "waterfall." It became popular in the early 2000s with the publication of the Agile Manifesto.

## Agile Manifesto & Principles

The **Agile Manifesto** was created in 2001 by 17 software developers to improve software development processes. It emphasizes:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
- **Responding to change** over following a plan  

Alongside these values, there are **12 Agile Principles** that guide Agile practices.

## Benefits of Agile over Traditional Methodologies

- Increased flexibility and adaptability to change  
- Faster delivery of value through iterative work cycles  
- Improved collaboration and communication among teams and stakeholders  
- Enhanced customer satisfaction with continuous feedback  
- Reduced risk through incremental delivery
