# Burndown Chart

A Burndown Chart is a visual tool that shows the amount of work remaining versus time in a Sprint or project.

## Purpose

- Track progress toward completing work  
- Provide visibility into whether the team is on schedule  

## Components

- **X-axis:** Time (days in Sprint or project)  
- **Y-axis:** Work remaining (story points, tasks, or hours)  
- **Ideal trend line:** Expected progress to finish on time  
- **Actual progress line:** Real progress made  

## Benefits

- Easy to understand and communicate status  
- Early identification of risks or delays  
- Supports Daily Scrum discussions  

## Limitations

- Does not show scope changes explicitly  
- May not reveal quality issues or blocked work
