# Lead Time & Cycle Time

Lead Time and Cycle Time are key metrics that measure the time taken for work items to progress through the workflow.

## Lead Time

- The total time from when a request is made (e.g., user story created) until it is completed  
- Measures overall responsiveness of the team  

## Cycle Time

- The time from when work actually starts on an item until it is completed  
- Measures efficiency during active work  

## Why They Matter

- Help teams identify delays and bottlenecks  
- Support forecasting and process improvement  
- Provide insight into customer wait times and delivery speed  

## How to Measure

- Track timestamps for work item states in the workflow  
- Calculate averages over a period (e.g., Sprint or month)
