# The 12 Agile Principles

The Agile Manifesto includes 12 guiding principles that support Agile values and practices.

1. **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.**  
2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.**  
3. **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.**  
4. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.**  
5. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.**  
6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation.**  
7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**  
8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**  
9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**  
10. **Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.**  
11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**  
12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**
