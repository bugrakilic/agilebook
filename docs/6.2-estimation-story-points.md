# Estimation & Story Points

Estimation in Agile helps teams forecast effort or complexity for backlog items, often using Story Points as a relative measure.

## What are Story Points?

- A unitless measure representing effort, complexity, and risk  
- Relative rather than absolute, allowing teams to compare tasks  

## Why Use Story Points?

- Avoids the pitfalls of time-based estimates  
- Encourages team discussion and consensus  
- Helps measure velocity and plan future Sprints  

## Common Techniques

- **Planning Poker:** Team members assign story points simultaneously and discuss discrepancies  
- **T-shirt Sizing:** Categorize tasks as XS, S, M, L, XL to simplify estimation  

## Best Practices

- Keep estimates relative within the team context  
- Re-estimate when more information becomes available  
- Use velocity (average story points completed per Sprint) to improve forecasting
