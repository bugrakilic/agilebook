# Sprint Review

The Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.

## Purpose

- Demonstrate the work completed during the Sprint  
- Gather feedback from stakeholders  
- Collaborate on what to do next  

## Participants

- Scrum Team  
- Stakeholders  
- Product Owner (facilitator)  

## Process

- The Development Team presents the completed Increment.  
- Stakeholders provide feedback, ask questions, and suggest changes.  
- The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog and potential adjustments based on feedback.  
- Collaboration on next steps and priorities for upcoming Sprints.

## Timebox

- Typically up to 1 hour per week of Sprint duration (e.g., 2 hours for a 2-week Sprint).

## Best Practices

- Encourage open and honest feedback  
- Focus on working product rather than documentation  
- Use feedback to refine the backlog and improve future planning
