# Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a short, time-boxed event held every day of the Sprint. It is designed to synchronize the teamâ€™s activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

## Purpose

- Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal  
- Adapt the plan to optimize the work remaining  

## Participants

- Development Team (mandatory)  
- Scrum Master (optional, typically facilitates)  
- Product Owner (optional)

## Format

- Usually a 15-minute stand-up meeting  
- Each team member typically answers three questions:  
  1. What did I do yesterday to help meet the Sprint Goal?  
  2. What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?  
  3. Are there any impediments blocking my progress?

## Best Practices

- Keep it focused and brief  
- Hold it at the same time and place every day  
- Use it as a coordination tool, not a status report for management  
- Address issues outside the meeting
