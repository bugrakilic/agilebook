# Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)

CI/CD are practices that enable teams to frequently integrate code changes and deliver software quickly and reliably.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- Developers merge code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day  
- Automated builds and tests run on every commit to detect issues early  
- Reduces integration problems and improves software quality  

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

- Extends CI by automatically deploying code to staging or production environments  
- Enables fast, reliable, and repeatable releases  
- Supports rapid feedback and iteration  

## Benefits

- Faster delivery of value to customers  
- Reduced risk of integration failures  
- Improved collaboration and transparency  

## Tools & Practices

- Automated testing frameworks  
- Build servers (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)  
- Deployment automation  
- Monitoring and rollback mechanisms
